                <p>One common phrase that annoys me recently is the saying: "I'm just doing my job" or "they're just doing their job"</p>
                <p>The saying isn't necessarily stupid or disingenuous, for example security guard removing people out of property and using the saying as an explanation to communicate/make the task go smoother isn't problematic. In general, 
                    if the actions with the job aren't immoral, I don't really have a practical issue with it, I just don't like the framing.</p>
                <p>the issue for me is using that phrase to handwave bad actions, and this phrase/defense is generally accepted by most people without much further thought regarding if it can be a valid justification for immoral behavior.
                </p>
                <p>From here there's atleast two types of common ideas people have when using the phrase: <br>
                    1. The action isn't actually bad or immoral <br>
                    2. Even the action is immoral the person is covered from responsibility due the fact that the action is part of the persons job
                </p>
                <p>Going over 1: <br> If the action is justified, there isn't really a need to use the phrase as an justification. You should be able to say that there's nothing wrong with the action/s 
                    and stop throwing the phrase around as a cover, instead of just saying that the action is moral and just.</p>
                <p>Going over 2: <br> This is an interesting stance if a person truly holds it, although I have a feeling that most people who think this
                     aren't really principled with the stance and in reality fall into stance 1.</p>
                <p>-Let's imagine a society where hitman services are legal - Would that make murder as a job justified? They're just doing their job.
                    You could have that stance, but it doesn't intuitively make sense to most people.</p>
                <p>From here we can draw that most people don't use this as their primary or only justification. Again, I would argue this is kind of bullshit point and the justifications coming after
                     the phrase are what really matter and from there we can actually come to the point of contention. </p>
                <p>In my opinion, if the action is immoral, it doesn't matter if it's done in pursuit of money or if the system behind orders to do the action,
                     it's immoral regardless and the person committing the act is responsible for it.</p>
                <p>There may be some forces/systems that make committing the action understandable but that doesn't make it not immoral.</p>
                <p>--I'll probably hash out my view regarding this more in the future, but I think this is a good base to start-- </p>

                  <p>Feeling pretty tired, I slept for about 4 hours last night and went to gym pretty soon after waking up, as usual, however I've felt considerably more tired today than usual. Hopefully I'll get good sleep next night before work.</p>
                  <p>I started reading Problems of Philosophy by Bertrand Russell yesterday, which has been pretty enjoyable this far. So far I'm 4 chapters in the book, as of today I have had super hard time concentrating so I only did read one chapter today.</p>
                  <p>I heard this book has quite a lot of bias from Russell so I'll keep that in the back of my mind, not sure if that's true but I have heard that being asserted by few people.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>A thing that I try to apply in my thinking from now on more is analyzing statements I hear by trying to put the argument in a propositional form and seeing if the conclusions follow. I feel There's a good amount of blindspots in my thinking, even though I have gotten better at it.</p>
                  <p>I have gotten better at noticing if arguments are valid without rephrasing them in propositional form but I think this will be interesting addition. Other thing I've gotten pretty good at noticing and acknowledging is the use of ad hominem in so many topics/discussion.</p>
                  <p>It's kind off surprising how common this is in most discourse. Also in a way surprising to me, I have noticed me ad hominem-ing myself. Idk how common this is but I notice I do this quite a lot, which on-top of being logically fallacious, is probably pretty unhealthy for my self-esteem and identity.</p>
                  <p>I'll illustrate the idea by general example:</p>
                  <p>Premise 1: I dislike trait (X) <br>
                    Premise 2: Trait (X) is on average more common in group (Y) than other groups in general <br>                 
                    Conclusion: I have more negative view of group (Y) than other groups in general  <br>                
                    ad-hominem: I might have this view because reason (Z) and I maybe wouldn't make this argument if not reason (Z)</p>
                  <p>The argument is ultimately about my preferences(I would assume premise 1 and the conclusion don't have truth value) However, the point here is to illustrate that it's internally consistent. Usually the nature of the ad-hominem also is strict internal critique that I can't rule out as not being a possibility, because to be able to rule it out I would need to be aware of my sub-conscious biases, which by definition I couldn't be aware of. Unless the sub-conscious would transform to conscious by doing something (maybe?) (I'm almost starting to justify logical fallacies here loll).</p>
                  <p>Also, for the argument above: This argument doesn't extend to individual agents in the group, just the group as a whole on average - as far as the groups exist as an socially constructed categories.(I'll need to flesh out my idea of social cosntructions in the future more, because I'm not that sure on how I feel about it)</p>
                  <p>The nature of trying to figure my own mind-state and a strict syllogistic argument are different but that kind of thought often comes up, during various different topics- in some of them it might be an okay thing and in some it's just stupid and mentally draining.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, it's getting late and tomorrow is Monday, so I'll cut it here.</p>

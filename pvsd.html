                <p>My short thesis for this post is that some disagreements which seem like principled disagreements, in reality are disagreements between degrees/where to draw the line. I see this pretty clearly in some cases, but sometimes it can be more difficult to spot. In many topics, the principled stance in reality is grounded in something more fundamental but can be hard to spot. I notice having difficulty with this myself too.</p>
                <p>This concept challenges my stance in Internet Surveillance a bit- in cases where some immoral behavior/acts are being done. It doesn't apply in cases where the behavior or acts aren't immoral. But maybe in outlier cases of immoral behavior- for example disinformation campaigns organized by foreign power designed to cause war and/or destabilization, it can apply. Intuitively for me, it does. <br>
                    Nevertheless. this is something for me to keep in mind.</p>

                <h2>An example: Vaccine Mandates</h2>
                <p>On the right, many people disagreed with vaccine mandates for covid. Often this was argued from the principled place of bodily autonomy. While that can be an angle to oppose vaccine mandates, I think most people having this position wouldn't apply the same reasoning if covid was of different nature.</p>
                <p>The nature of covid is irrelevant to my point here, I'm just using it as an example to illustrate the point. <br>
                    Also the nature of the covid vaccine is irrelevant to my point, I see no reason to favor the theory of covid vaccine being a bioweapon over the official narrative. Probabilistically I don't think you can make the case- that it being a bioweapon is more likely than the official narrative. If it was a bioweapon, the target people also wouldn't make sense. The people most likely to take the vaccine wouldn't be the group a hypothetical group developing a bioweapon would want to target.</p>
                <p>To the example: <br>
                    Hypothetically, if covid had 20% death-rate, the amount of people in favor of vaccine mandates would increase A LOT. The worse the disease is and the more effective the vaccine is, the more people will be in favor of vaccine mandates.</p>
                <p>You can increase the death rate in the hypothetical and modify to effectiveness of the vaccine to the point where basically every person is in favor of mandating the vaccine. This doesn't take into account the conspiratorial thinking and other effects in the world, but even if those same things apply in this hypothetical, I would say almost certainly this is the way it would play.</p>
                <p>So better framing for this disagreement, instead of principled bodily autonomy disagreement, is the disagreement on where to draw the line.</p>
                <p>This way to look at disagreements can apply to a wide variety of topics, but for this post I'll just cut it here at this example.</p>

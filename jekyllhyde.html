                <p>I finished reading "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" today, it was a good read. I stayed consistent and did read atleast a bit every day, even though sometimes it felt pretty hard to me-I'm proud of staying consistent and sticking to my plan.</p>
                <p>Also, holy fuck grammar can be hard :D I had quite a bit of problems with understanding terms and following everything in the book. Nevertheless, this was a good challenge for me.</p>
                <p>I especially liked the last chapter of Jekyll's statement on the case, and I fully get why Carl Jung would reference this book in "Man And His Symbols". I'm usually no fan of anything horror, but I overall enjoyed this, the reason being the concepts in the book and the more light feeling- for me.</p>
                <p>I feel good about having read this classic and understanding the possible references in depth in possible future, if this ever comes up (Probably won't lol)(Maybe with Jung) Regardless, I feel good about it.</p>
                <p>I might write more in-depth summary or analysis of the book in the future, the theme appeals to me and the metaphor to conscious/unconscious + human duality are interesting concepts. As for this post, this is just an update.</p>
                <p>Today is Sunday, and tomorrow I'll very very likely start my last week at work, most likely I'll only work for two days.</p>
                <p>I have a lot of plans where to focus then, when I have a lot of free-time. One thing that's for sure one of my goals that I'll start working from the start, is updating this site in terms of building it. There's a lot of things that are lacking. But I like that i've posted here regularly for the past month.</p>
                <p>I'm a bit of conflicted on what to do after work ends now. Since I have many paths I can pursue, and one value I want to follow, is acting in a way, that if my behavior would be universalized, the society wouldn't collapse.</p>
                <p>I think this value comes to the application of behavoir, for instance: if I would just fuck around and do nothing, that would go against this value. However, if I work on something I feel is meaningful, is productive and I think benefits society in some way, it wouldn't go against it. Even if the activities aren't straight work/have nothing to do with earning money</p>
                <p>The next step is to figure how to solve this puzzle.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this site is getting me used to this kind of work and maybe to publish something that's interesting, atleast to me.
                </p>
                <p>I have some topics in mind but I won't foreshadow anything for now, in case I'll change my opinions or don't feel like publishing said stuff in the future.
                </p>
                <p>Things are going pretty well for me at the moment, but I feel that I should try some new things and try to become knowledgeable in some things, in the past I have been pretty nihilistic about everything and generally haven't been a curious person.
                </p>
                <p>I wrote some ranting as a draft for this post but I think I'm just gonna keep this post general and not unhinged. There's some outside forces that bother me somewhat, although this time I try not to use that as an excuse to not do things.<br>
                It's probably a time for me to stop giving a fuck and letting others effect me to that large of an extend.                       
                </p>
                <p>For now - This site doesn't use javascript, just html and css so there won't be as much functionality, but I'll see how far I can go with this. <br>
                If you want to contact me, use the email at the bottom of the page. <br>
                I'll probably learn some more web-dev/web-design as the time goes on, or it becomes a necessity for managing the site. This is my first project of this kind.
                </p>
                <p>Let's see what comes from this :D</p>

              <div class="post-content">
                <p>The day at work at a new place went well. Don't really have anything to add there, I feel pretty good about the new thing.</p>
                <p>Yesterday I finished Jung's personal chapter in Man and His Symbols. I did read the chapter with good focus and took a lot of notes through it, I feel good about that.</p>
                <p>One novel I want to read, probably pretty soon is Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Jung referenced it atleast once in the chapter and I think having read it is good overall, since it's one of the classics in Western literature.</p>
                <p>I also started the dream diary and got a good diary entry yesterday on Sunday. By a good entry I mean I was able to remember a lot of the dream and was able to write it down pretty clearly and with details. I may publish it some day without analysis. I don't want to do analysis yet (although I have some thoughts popping up about it) But I want to get more knowledgeable about dream analysis from Jungian perspective before trying it. Also it's probably good to have more dreams logged before.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>New notes from Jung's personal chapter in Man and His Symbols: <br>
                    (These are unorganized and there's quite a bit of repetition of the same things, but I think that was Jung's intention, so the reader understands the concepts well) </p>
                <h2>Okay okay...</h2>
                <p>The dream analyst always brings his own conscious or unconscious biases into the analysis. This can extend to other kinds of psychological analysis too.</p>
                <p>Extraversion and introversion are different concepts in Jungian view than the more commonplace view of the concepts, even though the concepts originated from Jung. In Jungian view extroversion is the individual interacting more with physical/outside world and introversion is individual interacting more with his mind, opposed to external world.</p>
                <p>You can view intuition in the same way as sense perception, it isn't the same but some intuitions can be as clear as seeing a tree for example.</p>
                <p>Jung proposes four main functions of consciousness: two perceiving or non-rational functions (sensation and intuition) and two judging or rational functions (thinking and viewing) < just copied this from Wikipedia, I think this is a very good summary of the idea.</p>
                <p>Jung view feeling as an judgement call: Good or bad, agreeable or disagreeable. Different of the ordinary view. Feeling is not to be confused with intuition in Jung's view.</p>
                <p>When humans try to understand others minds, the normal tendency is to fill the gaps they don't understand with projection</p>
                <p>The reason dreams are often analogous and cryptic can be viewed as the language of unconscious, the languages and way unconscious and conscious operate, are different. The symbols and analogies in dreams aren't disguises on purpose, that's just the way the unconscious operates.</p>
                <p>The dream symbol/s can mean two completely different things, for example: You should/You shouldn't</p>
                <p>The mind is evolutionary thing, so it just makes sense that it would have some primitive "code" on it. You can view of the mind having different layers metaphorically. The core being the pre-conscious and over time other layers have developed with human evolution. Freud called the primitive "code" - "archaic remaints"</p>
                <p>Archaic remaints are mental forms that can't be explained by anything specific in individuals life. They're inneit and inherited things in the human mind.</p>
                <p>Jung refers to these things by "primordial images" and "archetypes"</p>
                <p>Jungian archetypes are not to be confused with widely known conscious categorizations, archetypes are the primitive unconscious categories, that appear in all kinds of different human societies across time and space. They're inneit and inherited, instinctive trends.</p>
                <p>Archetypes are without known origin - They reproduce and appear in any part of the world regardless of the time.</p>
                <p>If you identify psyche with consciousness, you can easily arrive to the conclusion that a human comes to world empty and everything the psyche has in the later years, has been due to individual experiences.</p>
                <p>The conscious operates with knowledge and reasoning, the unconscious seems to operate with instinctive trends - represented by corresponding thought forms - the archetypes.</p>
                <p>"The energy of archetypes can be focused (through rituals and other appeals to mass emotion) to move people to collective action"</p>
                <p>The origin of many rituals is unknown, many of them most likely have developed before consciousness had developed. Archetypes have pushed for example similar worship of god/s before human consciousness had developed and that's probably where many rituals are born from.</p>
                <p>As for example similar religious symbols seemingly disconnected without a link probably stem from archetypes, inneit inherited unconscious concepts with human mind - Collective unconscious.</p>
                <p>Every society has it's own view of archetypal paradise. For example in communism it's a just and moral leader ruling over the kindergarten of humanity where everyone's needs are met excessively. In capitalism it would be something like free market solving every problem of humanity.</p>
                <p>Western societies don't want to acknowledge it's own shadow, it's easier to look eastward and point out negatives.</p>
                <p>The sad truth is that mans life consists of opposites: Day and night, good and evil. birth and death, happiness and misery, the opposite that isn't acknowledged is the shadow </p>
                <p>Only in the modern times human widely thinks that they can do without religion, thoughts of afterlife and meaning of life.</p>
                <p>The concept of god and other religious ideas may be ingrained in the collective unconscious, even modern man can assume it not to be true, or true enough, the ideas still break into consciousness often "at any provocation".</p>
                <p>"It's the role of religious symbols to give meaning to the life of a man"</p>
                <p>A sense of wider meaning is what shields a person from depression and hopelessness.</p>
                <p>Such a myth, however isn't just a symbol invented consciously by men, They have happened. It isn't the man Jesus who invented the myth of god-man, it has existed for centuries before his birth, He himself was seized by this symbolic idea.</p>
                <p>Myths go back to the primitive storyteller and to his dreams.</p>
                <p>When human consciousness developed to a point like in ancient Greece, the ideas of god/s were dismissed as non-probable to be and mean what the ideas were. The same thing happened in psychology in it's infancy.</p>
                <p>The confusion arises because dream contents are symbolic and can have many interpretations, which can't be deduced consciously logically, in a scientific way. "they can't be formulated in way that is satisfactory to intellect and logic"</p>
                <p>Medical psychologist has to take the unconscious into account, even when not being able to scientifically demonstrate it's existence. The nature of it becomes obvious with practice.</p>
                <p>Much of the context of symbols depends on the maturity of the dreamer, as an example opening a locked door with a key.</p>
                <p>The interpretation of dreams and symbols demand intelligence, increasing knowledge of the dreamers individuality and strong self-awareness on the part of the interpreter. There's no guidebook way, but rules of thumb can be helpful, but they too should be applied critically.</p>
                <p>Intuition is almost indispensable on interpreting dreams, so that it can be immediately understood by the dreamer, on the other hand that can be dangerous too. Intuition isn't infallible.</p>
                <p>Difference between natural and cultural symbols: natural symbols stem from the unconscious place of the psyche, and there can be a lot of different variations of the same essential archetypal images. Cultural symbols have transformed as the time went on with conscious and unconscious processes and therefore have became symbolic images accepted by civilized societies.</p>
                <p>Archetypes are both images and emotions</p>
                <p>Just images by itself don't resonate, they have to connect to specific individual </p>
                <p>The names of them isn't important, but it's all-important how they're related to you.</p>
                <p>During development of the conscious mind, the mind before development of consciousness came unknown, the conscious mind has never known the original mind.</p>
                <p>It's all these unconscious things in the mind that the dream symbolism refers to.</p>
                <p>The gaps in childhood memory are the loss of primitive psyche.</p>
                <p>The task of dreams is to bring back the prehistoric, infantile world. Right to the level of most primitive instincts.</p>
                <p>Infant mind = prehistoric psyche</p>
                <p>Symbols are natural attempts to try and unite the opposites of the psyche.</p>
                <p>Consideration of feelings in psychology is important and necessary, even if some things can't be demonstrated, nevertheless it's scientifically and practically necessary to advance in the inquiry.</p>
                <p>Man has seemingly taken over the nature, but really hasn't taken over his own nature.</p>
                <p>The unconscious encompasses all aspects of human nature: Good and evil, beauty and ugly, profound and silly, dark and light.</p>

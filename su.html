                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>This post will be low-effort and unorganized but I'll try to summarize most of what has been going on.</p>
                    <p>The week at work was more hectic than usual, though it was good still, just some uncertainty and a lot of changes.</p>
                    <p>Earlier today I finished reading Problems of Philosophy and I feel pretty good about it, it was kind of a struggle because I didn't have much interest after the halfway point honestly, but now I have better understanding of some concepts, which is good. I stopped taking notes after 3 chapters which probably was a mistake. Not proud of that. One update I'll do to my reading projects is trying not to have the goal of reading X thing before Y date as much in mind as it has been this week.</p>
                    <p>Other thing that I'll implement is primarily focusing on building my knowledge in topics, because atm I feel that the time in day is more limited than I would want it to be.</p>
                    <p>For this weekend my plan is to plan how to use things I did learn from Atomic Habits and make some kind of schedule to my days + apply some more things I did learn from the book. Honestly I've been going on autopilot for most of the time.</p>
                    <p>Atm I'm interested in Carl Jungs works, so I'll take getting familiar with his ideas as my next goal. There's a lot of interesting ideas from Jung that (I think) I'm vaguely familiar but really haven't read anything from him.</p>
                    <p>Some of Jungs ideas are kinda spooky to me and I'm not sure if psycho-analysis will interfere with my other goals of developing my identity. One thing I'll try to keep in mind is to not buy into all things from any author and take information that makes sense to me- Bits and pieces.</p>

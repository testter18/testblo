                <p>This post is more or less just an experiment for me to put on some light pressure on myself
                 so I can see if there's an effect or if I notice anything interesting psychologically.</p>
                <p>I've been interested in this book for a bit and think it will be good to read,
                 I've been lacking on reading for like couple months and feel it will be good to step up on that area now that
                 I'm not learning how to build this website. Also I feel this book can apply to so many areas in my life now- and in the future.</p>
                <p>The case for why I initially started slacking on reading after having a good streak was (in my opinion) because of outside forces
                that made me depressed and angry, and in some way not looking forward to future again 
                after a good streak of progressing forward, I may be looking for an excuse but I'm not the person to be objective about it.</p>
                <p>The outside forces still anger the fuck out of me, but I'll continue to push forward. I built this site and learnt
                html and css while working,
                while being under the same pressures so I already have an instance where I was able to overcome it to some extend.</p>
                <p>About reading overall - Before the current break, I feel I got a good amount of enjoyment and most importantly
                I was able to learn and retain information from reading, 
                and I think it's time to get back at it now that I'm not focusing on other stuff.</p>
                <p>I might write a more general post about reading or stuff that has something to do with reading in the future,
                but for now, I'll see the effect- if any, writing about goals like this will have.</p>
                <p>I did read the preface of Atomic Habits before writing this post but at the least tomorrow- after work I'll start to read it fully,
                it's gonna be late when this post is published. 
                My goal is to read with focus for about 3h a day atleast, hopefully finishing it by next Sunday (At the time of writing it's Monday)</p>
                <p>That about sums it up :D</p>

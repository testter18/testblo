               <p>True internet anonymity doesn't exist in the current year, or possibly has ever existed.</p>
               <p>The governments/branches in the government have the ability to monitor basically everything you do with a weak 
                pretext or without pretext at all (depending on how much you trust the institutions). </p>
                <p>There's many parties monitoring internet usage of the people, prominently massive companies and state governments,
                    in this post I'm just going to focus on state surveillance.
                <p>At this point I think we should ask if there should be the possibility to use internet anonymously or is the surveillance worth
                 it in the name of security? it's kind of hard line to draw, there's immoral behavior that the surveillance undeniably stops, but should
                  it be possible to use internet or communicate truly anonymously, or should we just drop the illusion of internet anonymity?</p>
                <p>I think there's a place for truly anonymous communication or internet use, not the current norm where it's anonymous as long as the people in the charge want it to be and then fuck you, you don't really have anonymity or liberty.
                 Just drop the illusion and move from there, because it's clear that those things aren't principled positions. <br>
                 (I think Infiltration tactics are better way to deal with immoral anonymous behaivour than abandoning the whole concept of anonymity)
                </p>
                <p>This also isn't a thing that only applies to dissidents or criminals, it may seem like that but at one point
                 I see it as a quite high possibility that normal-ish people will be effected too.</p>
                 <p>The common analogy of a bulldozer driving over people and at some point when everyone you view as deserving it has been ran over, it will be your turn, seems fitting for the situation in my opinion.
                 If anonymity and liberty are illusions and conditional on you behaving accordingly, the concepts don't mean anything in reality.</p>
                <p>It seems like a pretty normal take on this is yourself being the person driving the bulldozer, and in a way I can see that, if you accept the premise that 
                everyone/every group will inevitably behave in that way. Which may be true, I might lean a bit idealist specifically on this topic. </p>
                <p>It could just be a way of the world.</p>
                <p>Few last words: <br>
                If you're the one driving the bulldozer, <br>
                <span class="underline">don't be surprised if something you think is bad happens to you</span> <br>
                That's all.</p>

                <p>This summary is originally written couple months ago. I'm just publishing it now. As far as the style of this post goes,
                I won't make opinions whether or not I agree with the methodology or arguments. There's very little commentary. <br>
                Basically these are my notes.</p>
                <p>-----</p>
                <p>The dialogue starts instantly by Meno asking Socrates if virtue can be taught.</p>
                <p>From here Socrates tries to get Meno to give a definition of virtue to progress in the inquiry,
                but instead Meno lists a bunch of virtues, not what virtue itself is.</p>
                <p>Meno understands what Socrates is getting at and comes up with a definition for virtue: <br>
                "Rule well in a just way"</p>
                <p>Socrates points out that the definition is (implicitly?) circular, because earlier Meno named justice as a virtue. <br>
                Therefore virtue is implicitly mentioned in the definition: "Rule well in a just way"</p>
                <p>Circular definitions can't convey meaning</p>
                <p>At some point Meno points that if you don't know what virtue is, you can't search for it-
                because you don't know what virtue is, you wouldn't be able to tell it even if you saw it.</p>
                <p>The concept of Meno's paradox comes here, Socrates phrases the paradox this way: <br>
                "A man cannot enquire either about that which he knows, or about that which he does not know, for if he knows, he has no need to enquire:
                and if not, he cannot: for he does not know the very subject about which he is to enquire."</p>
                <p>Here Socrates points out to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms">Theory of Recollection/Theory of Forms</a>
                and argues that the soul knows what virtue is, and inquiry can point to what virtue itself is.</p>
                <p>-----</p>
                <p>To the question whether or not virtue can be taught:</p>
                <p>Socrates argues that virtue cannot be taught
                because high-up Athenians haven't been able to teach virtue to their sons, despite being able to teach all kinds of other things.</p>
                <p>If virtue could be taught, like for example shoemaking, there would be teachers teaching it.
                There's no teachers or pupils with virtue as a subject.</p>
                <p>People also aren't born with virtue, and people can't recollect virtue, so soul doesn't contain virtue by this hypothesis
                according the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms">Theory of Recollection.</a> </p>
                <p>Socrates doesn't claim to know where virtue comes from, but infers that virtue is a gift from gods.</p>

              <div class="post-content">
                <p>Feeling a bit anxious, I guess for that reason reading today hasn't been as efficient. I can still remember things and retain information  despite being in worse mind-state than usual, which is a good sign. I'm pretty sure my attention-span is healing/has healed a lot.</p>
                <p>Today was the last day of work at the previous place. Now the place will be a lot further away, but it's nice that I can still develop myself in a mental way. Like a vote towards my identity. I think my extra effort is paying off, even when I occasionally feel that my mental state is worse than at times of self-destructive behavior. But with how I'm currently operating, I don't think it's likely for me to regret it.</p>
                <p>Today I have consumed a lot of negativity, which most likely effects my mood. Probably to pretty large extend. Those are the things I will try to cut off, and I already have some of it, for example I deleted my twitter account and haven't used it in like a month. Also not consuming as much political content, or more accurately: Not consuming overly/explicitly political content. There's a certain privilege in being able to distance myself from that, since those things don't effect me personally. (I'm talking about charged stuff) There's ofc future problems.</p>
                <p>Alright alright, about Carl Jung:</p>
                <p>I did read Jung's Wikipedia article for base and have been reading "Man And His Symbols" for couple/few days, slowly but efficiently absorbing the material. I'm about half-way in Jung's chapter and the material is interesting. The way I'm at the moment viewing Jung and I guess psychology more broadly is thinking and viewing the ideas as mental models.</p>
                <p>So far Jung's mental model resonates with me, the idea of unconscious not being a merely storage facility of previously conscious thoughts and that conscious thoughts can rise from the unconscious, as in the example Jung gave: When moving on autopilot you retain a lot of things unconsciously and only when thinking backward, the things come conscious.</p>
                <p>I also was kind of pleased that Jung also views all experiences going through the filter of human mind and that the things in itself are unknowable (A view I'm familiar and see the same way) So everything is essentially a psychic experience, every concept in the mind has it's own psychic associations.</p>
                <p>with words the concept is the same, every word means something slightly different to every person, by this I mean that words interact with each persons unconscious atleast slightly differently and have different associations.</p>
                <p>Unconscious contains the vast majority of things in the mind between the conscious/unconscious, this makes sense because the conscious can't hold all the things at the same time, this can be viewed as there not being enough space there and mind changing the places of things around between conscious and unconscious.</p>
                <p>Unconscious associations is an interesting concept for me, and it makes sense to me. i feel this can be very dark but it is topic-dependent, the concept applies to so many things in the real world and for me most of things that come to mind about this concept are pretty dark (I probably have more dark mind than the average person). </p>
                <p>If the conscious and unconscious don't match, there's huge differences or contradictions, disturbances happen.</p>
                <p>I'm not done with dream analysis section but here's some notes I took about the concepts that resonate with me this far:</p>
                <p>You can view the function of dreams as the counterbalance of the conscious and unconscious. Symbolism in dreams can be seen as the unconsciousness communicating.</p>
                <p>Dream symbolism can be complicated, the most obvious connection might not be true, the dreams should be assessed in full.</p>
                <p>In modern times we have gotten used to saying things as accurately as possible, but in dreams the primitive associations, that every object or idea possesses are more obvious.</p>
                <p>There's a huge danger in incompetent or unintelligent dream analysis.</p>
                <p>"No dream symbol can be separated form the individual who dreams it, and there is no definite or straightforward interpretation of any dream"</p>
                <hr>
                <p>One thing that I'll start doing again is writing a dream diary. It's been years since last time + I really have done it a very little at all, but reading Jung inspires me to try it again. At first I'll do only weekends (this might be pussying-out) but during weekends I'll put that as a mandatory thing to do. One place where I could probably fit it pretty well on weekdays is when I'm eating a breakfast...<br>
                    That's a thing to consider for sure.</p>
                <p>At the end of writing this post, and actually during writing it too, my mood is actually good now :D</p>
                <p>ps. Oh, this is also my 10th post on the site, gz me</p>

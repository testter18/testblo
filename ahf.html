                <p>As of Friday 20th, I finished reading Atomic Habits. this week has been pretty good and surprisingly to me, I was in a flow state a good amount while reading.</p>
                <p>I was vaguely familiar with most of the concepts in the book, but the presentation is very good imo. The book is very dense on substance and the structure is good, so I would definitely recommend this book if you're interested in self-improvement reading.</p>
                <p>The book also gives a good amount of practical advice on how to implement the concepts in your life + the concepts are pretty universal, so they appeal to wide range of topics.</p>
                <p>I will definitely implement some concepts of the book to my life as well.</p>

                 <h2> The Fundamentals</h1>

                <p>Thinking what kind of person you want to be -> <br>
                    Living consistently like that kind of person would live -> <br>
                    That becoming your identity over time when repeated <br>
                    ("Fake till you make it" but more deeper)</p>
                <p>Identity isn't hardlocked, to become the best version of yourself you should be open to expanding your identity</p>
                <p>Identity emerges from habits, you can think of every habit as a vote for what kind of person you will be in the future</p>
                <p>"The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself."</p>
                <p>Small changes compound over time.</p>
                <p>Progression isn't linear, small changes don't seem noticeable until you cross a critical threshold.
                    Drastic changes of compounding are delayed</p>
                <p>Systems are more important than goals, for example: learning and doing in a good way vs just doing X thing before Y date (both can be used but other is more important)</p>
                <p>Instead of focusing what you want, focus on who you want to be.</p>
                <p>"The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are: <br>
                    1. Make it Obvious <br>
                    2. Make it Attractive <br>
                    3. Make it Easy <br>
                    4. Make it Satisfying." <br></p>
                
                <h2>1st Law - Make it Obvious</h2>

                <p>Implementation of plans for actions: I will do (X action) at (Y time) </p>
                <p>Pay attention your habits, a lot of things we do are being done on autopilot. Trying to be conscious can show you surprising things you aren't aware of.</p>
                <p>Point and State: (I'm doing X now/I will do X now) will make you aware of your behavior very efficiently.</p>
                <p>Making a list of your habits will give you a good insight of your unconscious behavior </p>
                <p>Associate a habit with a cue, for example when finishing a cup of coffee after work, start reading.</p>
                <p>Habit stacking: After a good habit that you already do daily, stack another habit at the end of it and use the earlier habit or activity as a cue.</p>
                <p>Make the cues for habits easily visible, For example: workout gear clearly visible, healthy foods clearly visible, book you want to read on the way of computer screen/on top of a laptop.</p>
                <p>Change your environment so that the cues for good habits are very visible.</p>
                <p>for the inversion of the 1st Law - Remove the cues for bad habits from your environment </p>

                <h2>2nd Law - Make it Attractive</h2>

                <p>The more attractive habit is, the more easy it's to become habit-forming</p>
                <p>The anticipation of a thing is what gets us to take action.</p>
                <p>Stack a thing you need to do with a thing you want to do, for example: reading X amount of time before watching a YouTube video.</p>
                <p>Society's role of forming habits - Three groups of people that have an effect on what habits we form: <br>
                    1. The Close (Family, Friends) <br>
                    2. The many (Work group, social group) <br>
                    3. The Powerful (Exceptional people in a subject or activity)</p>
                <p>Belonging in a group is normal and people have a feeling of needing to belong, we're drawn into a behavior that a group values</p>
                <p>X behavior of a group can and often does overrun the individual want for behavior Y with social pressure (Asch's line test for example)</p>
                <p>Cravings are often the manifestation of more fundamental desire, for example the fundamental desire for smoking is stress relief, smoking is the habit/solution for the more fundamental desire (stress relief) and the brain associates smoking as the solution.</p>
                <p>Habits are modern solutions for ancient desires, the desires and the underlying biology hasn't changed in 50000 years, but the environment has massively changed.</p>
                <p>Reframing things in your head can make a big difference (this can require rigorous consistency) for example: <br>
                    Having to work out -> Opportunity to improve health and improve your physique <br>
                    Having to study -> Opportunity to get smarter/improve your knowledge </p>
                <p>The inversion of the 2nd Law - Make it unattractive, reframe bad habits by their worst aspects</p>

                <h2>3rd Law - Make it Easy</h2>

                <p>Path of the least resistance is the default behavior for humans</p>
                <p>There's decisive moments in days that can alter the trajectory of the day massively: Do I open a book, do I go for a run, do I go to gym</p>
                <p>For these moments, you can implement the "2-Minute Rule" which is the downscaled version of the habit. <br>
                    Reading -> Reading a page <br>
                    Running -> Putting on running shoes <br>
                    Exercising -> Pack your gym clothes and get outside</p>
                <p>Master showing up before mastering the full goal, for example: <br>
                    Show up to the gym every day as planned <br>
                    Read a page every day</p>
                <p>Decrease friction with good habits, increase friction with bad habits</p>
                <p>Design your environment so that making good choices is easy and making bad choices is hard.</p>
                <p>Inversion of the 3rd Law - Make it difficult, add friction and make it require extra effort</p>

                <h2>4th Law - Make it Satisfying</h2>

                <p>Delayed vs instant gratification</p>
                <p>Human brains aren't designed for modern world, the brain prioritizes instant gratification.</p>
                <p>For positive behavior, a reward at the end primes you to repeat that behavior.</p>
                <p>In modern world, the general rule regarding instant and delayed gratification regardless of the activity (you can probably come up with an counterexample) is: <br>
                    Behavior with instant gratification: Bad <br>
                    Behavior with delayed gratification: Good</p>
                <p>"The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided"</p>
                <p>The first 3 Laws of behavior change increase the likelihood that the behavior is performed this time, the 4th Law increases the likelihood that the behavior is performed in the future.</p>
                <p>Habit tracking - And tracking  the habit immediately provides a great benefit</p>
                <p>Tracking offers three benefits/Laws: <br>
                    1. It's obvious <br>
                    2. It's attractive <br>
                    3. It's satisfying</p>
                <p>Don't break the streak, showing up daily adds up massively, even if the work isn't up to normal days the volume will make up for it.</p>
                <p>Showing up on bad days is more important than showing up on normal days.</p>
                <p>Showing up also reaffirms your identity on what kind of person you want to become.</p>
                <p>The inversion of the 4th Law - Make it unsatisfying, when slacking or doing negative activities, immediate "punishment" is effective.</p>
                <p>As in the case of reward - It's good to reward good habit instantly, it's also good to punish bad habit instantly.</p>
                <p>
                    Feeling accountable can be powerful <br>
                    Habit contract: <br>
                    If I don't do (X) I have to do (Y) <br>
                    x = Wanted Habit <br>
                    Y = Something unpleasant/unsatisfying</p>

                <h2>Advanced</h2>

                <p>Genetics: Play a role that suits you, try to compete in areas you're more gifted in naturally.</p>
                <p>Different personality types are more suited for different things</p>
                <p>Focusing on more specific market/thing can reduce the competition in that specific area, play to your strengths: <br>
                If you can do multiple things relatively well, you can combine your skills and do something unique that many people aren't doing</p>
                <p>Goldilocks rule: Spent most time practicing/learning just slightly above your skill, challenge yourself constantly but in a way that you don't get overwhelmed by difficulty, your motivation should be  high at about this level.</p>
                <p>As habits get more automatic, there's a possible pitfall on not paying attention to finer details of the habit. Reflection and review can be very beneficial for this possible problem.</p>
                <p>Good way to keep yourself honest is tracking and looking back on how you've done things, for example: <br>
                    Checking once a month if your performance is steady, getting better, or getting worse.</p>
                <p>Mastering a skill usually requires mastering multiple habits and building extra stuff on top of a solid base.</p>
                <p>When thinking of your identity, it's better to think of your identity more fundamentally, in case you want to change area you're focusing, for example: <br>
                    I'm good at fitness and training -> I'm a person who's disciplined, consistent and hard working</p>
                <p>"The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it"</p>
                <p>"Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery"</p>

                <h2>Last Remarks</h2>

                <p>Small habits stacked on top of each other will compound massively</p>
                <p>Good system will make a massive difference over time</p>
                <p>Using one or more of the 4 Laws will make everything easier and the laws are a powerful tools at your disposal for self-improvement</p>
                <p>"The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It's remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop"</p>
                <p>"Small habits don't add up. They compound"</p>

                <h2>-End of Notes-</h2>

                <p>Whew... :D</p>
                <p>If you're still here, thanks for reading. I hope you got some new ideas from my notes and learnt something new. <br>
                 I would higly recommend reading the book itself, if the substance in the notes seems interesting or beneficial to you. The book explains the concepts way better than I can and you will get way more out of it.</p>
